GIMLI ROOT README

Gimli is an interpreter, written in Haskell, for the Genetics
Information Manipulation Language, a domain-specific language designed
to make working with genetics-related data sets easier.  The language
was part of a short-lived research project that, unfortunately, lost
its funding.  The language and interpreter are both woefully incomplete.

Nevertheless, I decided to put the code on GitHub, on the small chance
somebody will find something useful in it.  The code has been doing
nothing for half a decade, so it's out of date by modern Haskell
standards, and parts of it are in rough shape.  It does build,
however, on recent releases of GHC (6.12.3 works fine, for example).

I don't expect to work on the project again.  If you find anything
in it useful, great -- but I can't offer support.

To build the project, see the README in the gimli/ subdirectory.

Sparse user documentation can be found in the user-guide/ directory.
It's in LaTeX format; run "make" to compile it into PDF format for
reading.
