* How to build Gimli

The following sections describe how to build Gimli from source code.

** Requirements

In order to build Gimli, you must have a typical Unix-style development
environment, including the following:

  - Glasgow Haskell Compiler, version 6.4 or greater
    http://haskell.org/ghc/
  - Perl, version 5.8 or greater
  - make (GNU preferred)
  - rsync
  - Readline library

For Mac OS X development, you must also have Apple's XCode installed.

** Building

From the root of the project directory, run the following command:

    $ make

If all goes well, the Gimli interactive shell will be built in the
app subdirectory.  If something goes wrong, make sure you have a
complete development kit.

Test the shell by running the test suite:

    $ make test

A successful test looks something like this:

    $ make test
    prove test/*.t
    test/01-sanity....ok
    test/expr.........ok
    test/inspect......ok
    test/state........ok
    test/table........ok
    test/vector.......ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=6, Tests=153,  6 wallclock secs ...


* Running Gimli

To start Gimli, enter the following command from the project root:

    $ app/gimli
          _       _ _
     __ _(_)_ __ | (_)    Genetics Information Manipulation Language, ...
    / _` | | '  \| | |    Version 0.004
