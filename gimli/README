* Notice of abandonment

I haven't worked on this project for half a decade and probably won't
anytime soon.  I'm making it available primarily for the benefit of
people who might want to look at the code.  If that's you, great --
but please don't ask for support.

You can build the Gimli interpreter for GIML (the Genetics Information
Manipulation Language), and it runs, but it's not very useful because
the GIML language is incomplete.  (The research project lost its
funding about one-third into the timeline.)  It has much of its
intended data-manipulation features, but general-programming features
are painfully lacking.


* License

The code is in this project is licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, v. 3, with the following exceptions:

  - ExprParser.hs was written by Daan Leijen and is licensed
    under Parsec's BSD-style license.  A modified version
    is included in this project.


* How to build Gimli

The following sections describe how to build Gimli from source code.

** Requirements

In order to build Gimli, you must have a typical Unix-style development
environment, including the following:

  - Glasgow Haskell Compiler, version 6.4 or greater
    http://haskell.org/ghc/
  - The Cabal build system for Haskell projects (bundled with GHC)
  - Perl, version 5.8 or greater
  - make (GNU preferred)
  - rsync

For Mac OS X development, you must also have Apple's XCode installed.

** Building

From the root of the project directory, run the following command:

    $ make

If all goes well, the Gimli interactive shell will be built in the
app subdirectory.  If something goes wrong, make sure you have a
complete development kit.

Test the shell by running the test suite:

    $ make test

A successful test looks something like this:

    $ make test
    prove test/*.t
    test/01-sanity....ok
    test/expr.........ok
    test/inspect......ok
    test/state........ok
    test/table........ok
    test/vector.......ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=6, Tests=153,  6 wallclock secs ...


* Running Gimli

To start Gimli, enter the following command from the project root:

    $ dist/build/gimli/gimli
          _       _ _
     __ _(_)_ __ | (_)    Genetics Information Manipulation Language, ...
    / _` | | '  \| | |    Version 0.004
    \__, |_|_|_|_|_|_|    Enter :? for help.

Enter the command :? for help.
