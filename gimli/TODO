TODO  -*- Outline -*-

* Summary to-do items

  X additional boolean ops: | || & &&
  X op %in%
  X richer vector construction
  X remaining join ops
  X richer projection specifications
  X data export (write.wsv)
  - logging
  - interrupt trapping (so you can use ^C to interrupt computations)

* Projection
  - Allow fuzzy matching of list/table elements like for fncall args:
    list(xyz=1)$x ==> 1

* Eval

X Get rid of VError: add ErrorT to Eval monad stack


* Bugs

! I/O error during read.x casues Gimli to exit:

  gimli> ov <- read.wsv("ov.wsv")
  gimli: ov.wsv: openFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
  [thor@bifur cycles]$


! write.wsv cannot be read back in when > 9 rows because row number
  is interpreted as a column:

     cycle ovu.day ovu.conf
   1 50902      17   "high"
   2 50807      15   "high"
   3 50713      14   "high"
   4 51617      15   "high"
   5 50522      14    "low"
   6 50426      15   "high"
   7 50331      16   "high"
   8 50308      14   "high"
   9 40828      15   "high"
  10 40803      15    "med"
  11 40708      15   "high"


X Associativity is wrong for Show instances when terms are of
  same precdence:

      gimli> :i 1 - (1 - 1)
      1 - 1 - 1
