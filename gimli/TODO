TODO  -*- Outline -*-

* Summary to-do items

  X additional boolean ops: | || & &&
  X op %in%
  X richer vector construction
  X remaining join ops
  X richer projection specifications
  X data export (write.wsv)
  - logging
  - interrupt trapping (so you can use ^C to interrupt computations)

* Projection
  - Allow fuzzy matching of list/table elements like for fncall args:
    list(xyz=1)$x ==> 1

* Eval

X Get rid of VError: add ErrorT to Eval monad stack


* Bugs

- Associativity is wrong for Show instances when terms are of
  same precdence:

      gimli> :i 1 - (1 - 1)
      1 - 1 - 1
